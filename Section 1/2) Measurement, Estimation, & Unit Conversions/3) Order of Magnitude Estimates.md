## Orders of Magnitude
The <u>order of magnitude</u> of a quantity is the quantity to the nearest power of 10.
**Example:** 2500 has an order of magnitude of 1000, or 10<sup>3</sup>
We say two numbers have the same order of magnitude of a number if the big one divided by the little one is less than ten.
**Example:** 524 and 745 are of the same order of magnitude.
Orders of magnitude are often used to when making approximations or comparisons of quantities.
## Fermi Problems
A <u>Fermi problem</u> involves making an order magnitude approximation with little or no actual data, just by making reasonable guesses.
Enrico Fermiâ€™s famous problem: How many piano tuners are there in the city of Chicago?
**Example:** How many ping pong balls can fit in this room?
