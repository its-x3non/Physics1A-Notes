## Vectors Quantities and Scalar Quantities
A <u>scalar</u> quantity is completely described by a number alone. There is no direction associated with a scalar quantity.
The number of people in this room is an example of scalar quantity.
A <u>vector</u> quantity is described by both a magniude and a direction.
Force is an example of a vector quantity. (e.g., pushing a box due East with 150 pounds of force.)
