# The Nature of Science
- Observation: Important first step toward scientific theory; requires imagination to tell what is important.
- Theories: created to explain observations; will make predictions
- Observations will tell if the prediction is accurate, and the cycle goes on.
- The physics world view is a dynamic one.
- Ideas are constantly being proposed, debated, and tested against the material world.
- Some survive the scrutiny of the community of physicists; some donâ€™t.
- The inclusion of new ideas often forces the rejection of previously accepted ones.
- Some firmly accepted ideas in the world view are very different to discard; in the long run, however, experimentation wins out over personal biases.
# How does a new theory get Accepted?
- Predictions agree better with data
- Explains a greater range of phenomena
# Mathematics and Physics
- Physical Processes are often described through mathematical formulation in order to describe past behavior and predict future outcomes based on present conditions.
- The mathematics in this course will make extensive use of algebra and trigonometry as well as some calculus.
- Linear & Quadratic Equations
- Multiple Equations w/ Multiple Unknowns
- Logarithms
- Trig
- Exponentials
- Calculus
