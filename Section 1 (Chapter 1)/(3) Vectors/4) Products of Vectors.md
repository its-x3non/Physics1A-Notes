## Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar Quantity
If you multiple a vector by a scalar, the result is a vector with a magnitude that gets scaled up or down, depending on the size of the scalar.
If the scalar is positive, the direction of the result is the same as the direction of the original vector.
If the scalar is negative, the direction of the results is opposite that of the original vector.

## The Scalar Product (2 of 2)
The scalar product can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the angle between

## Calculating a Scalar Product using Components
In terms of Components: (equation)
The scalar product of 2 vectors is the sum of products of their representative components.
