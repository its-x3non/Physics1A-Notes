## Vectors in Cartesian Form
In <u>Cartesian Form</u>, vectors are expressed in terms of x and y components:

The components of a vector are the projections onto the x and y axis components.
- Components can be negative
- x and y components and magnitude form a right triangle

## Transforming from Polar to Cartesian Form
Using trig, we can go from polar to the Cartesian representation:
- ![[Polar to Cartesian Form 1 (cos).png]]
- ![[Polar to Cartesian Form 2 (sin).png]]
These relations only work fi the angle theta is measured counterclockwise from the +x axis.

## Transforming from Cartesian to Polar Form
Using trig, we can go from the Cartesian to the polar representation of a vector:
- Magnitude of a Vector = ![[Cartesian to Polar 1 (Magnitude of a Vector).png]]
- ![[Cartesian to Polar 2.png]]
- How to find Angle = ![[Cartesian to Polar 3 (How to Find Angle).png]]
This relation only works if the angle is counterclockwise from the +x axis.
You also must be careful as more than one answer satisfies tan<sup>-1</sup>.

## Working with the Arctangent Function
The arctangent function is commonly written as arctan(), tan<sup>-1</sup>, or sometimes atan().
You need to be careful when using the arctangent function to calculate an angle.

**Problem**: The arctangent function outputs values between -90 and 90, but theta ranges between 0 and 360.
How do you find the correct values of theta in each quadrant?
