## Unit Vectors
A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of one, which points along one of the coordinate directions.
The unit vectors are all perpendicular to each other.
- ![[Hat I (lowercase).png]] points along the +x direction
- ![[Hat J (lowercase).png]] points along the +y direction
- ![[Hat K (lowercase).png]] points along the +z direction
Unit vectors are the building blocks of all other vectors

## Final Note on Unit Vectors
A vector in Cartesian Form is expressed using unit vectors: (equation)
Unit vectors are the building blocks of other vectors. They allow us to express _any_ vector as a sum of vectors aligned with the coordinate axes.
