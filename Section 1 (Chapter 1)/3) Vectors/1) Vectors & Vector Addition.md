## Vectors Quantities and Scalar Quantities
**<u>Scalar</u> Quantity** - Described by a number alone. There is no direction associated with a scalar quantity.
The number of people in this room is an example of scalar quantity.
**<u>Vector</u> Quantity** - Described by both a magnitude and a direction.
Force is an example of a vector quantity. (e.g., pushing a box due East with 150 pounds of force.)

## Graphical Representation of Vectors
The <u>magnitude</u> is the overall size of a vector quantity, represented by the length of an arrow.
The magnitude of a vector may have units attached to it.

**Example:** The magnitude of a velocity vector can be expressed in units of m/s (or miles/hr, etc.)

The <u>direction</u> refers to the orientation of the  vector in space, usually given by an angle.

## Equality of Vectors
Two vectors are equal as long as they have the same magnitude and they point in the same direction.

All of the vectors shown in the future to the right are equal. Vectors do not have to start from the same point to be equal.

## Representing Vectors in Polar and Cartesian Form
There are 2 ways to represent a vector:
**<u>Polar Form</u>****** - in terms of the vector’s magnitude and direction.
**<u>Cartesian Form</u>**- in terms of the vector’s x and y components.

Both forms completely describe a vector, and you can transform from one form to the other.
For addition/subtraction of vectors, it is usually easier to work in Cartesian form.

## Vectors in Polar Form
Suppose we have a vector A that lies in the x-y plane, as shown below. 
- <u>Polar Form</u> - two numbers are need to completely describe the vector: Ө and ![[Vector A (uppercase).png]]
- <u>Direction (Ө)</u> - The angle that A makes with respect to some reference line, usually measured counterclockwise from the +x axis.
- <u>Magnitude</u> ( ![[Vector A (uppercase).png]] ) - The length of the vector. The magnitude of a vector cannot be negative.

## Degrees and Radians
An angle measured in <u>radians</u> in a ratio of a length of an arc on a circle to the radius of the circle:
**Ө\[rad\] = s/r**
Radians are *not* a conventional unit (like a meter), since s/r is a dimensionless number.
**Conversion Factor:** Radians to Degrees =  ![[Conversion Factor (Radians to Degrees).png]]

## Drawing Vector Diagrams
- Draw the x and y axes
- Chose a scale factor. What do the gridlines on your graph paper physically represent?
- Use a protractor to measure the direction of your factor
- Use a rule to measure the magnitude of your vector.

# Vector Addition (& Subtraction)
## Vector Addition
When adding vectors, the directions must be taken into account. You can't simply add their magnitudes.
There are 2 methods for adding vectors:
- **Graphical Methods:** The vectors are drawn on a diagram, and the sum is found through geometry or by making measurements from the diagram.
### Adding Vectors Graphically
First draw the vectors “tip-to-tail” - the end of one vector is connected to the start of the next vector.
The <u>resultant</u> (the sum of the vectors) is draw from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the last vector.
Then, measure the length of resultant vector ![[Vector R (uppercase).png]] and its angle relative to the x axis.

When you have more than two vectors, simply connect all of the vectors using the “tip-to-tail” method - the order does not matter.
As before, the resultant vector is drawn from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the last vector.
This method works for any number of vectors.

- **Algebraic Methods:** The vectors are expressed purely in terms of numbers and the sum is calculated numerically.
### Algebraic Method of Adding Vectors
Suppose we want to find the resultant vector when we add 2 vectors together:
![[Vector R (uppercase).png]] = ![[Vector A (uppercase).png]] + ![[Vector B (uppercase).png]]
- Break each vector into x and y components:
- Add the vectors together:
- Group the Components:

## Subtracting Vectors
Subtracting a vector is the same as adding its negative, and the negative of a vector is just the vector flipped 180<sup>o</sup>.
