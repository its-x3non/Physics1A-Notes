## Units of Measurement
Every measurement is given by 2 parts: a number and a unit.
In physics, we primarily use the SI (System International) units. In this system, the base units are: seconds (s) for time, meters (m) for length, kilograms (kg) for mass.
You can express all other quantities we'll encounter in this class using the base units.
**Example:** Speeds are given in meters per second (m/s)

## Units, Standards, and the SI System
## Unit Prefixes
For quantities that are very small or large, unit prefixes are useful. These are simply powers of ten that multiply units.

## Unit Conversion
To express a quantity in different units, multiply by a ratio which is equal to 1, called a <u>conversion factor</u>.
**Examples:**
- 12 in / 1 ft
- 24 hr / 1 day
- 100 cm / 1 m

## Dimensional Analysis
The <u>dimensions</u> of a quantity refers to the type of quantity, without reference to specific units. All quantities that you will encounter in Physics 4A are some combination of length (L), time (T), and mass (M).

**Example:** Speed is the distance traveled over time, L/T
The units can be m/s, miles/hr, km/s, etc.
**Example:** Density is a mass over a volume, M/L<sup>3</sup>
The SI unit is kg/m<sup>3</sup>

A <u>dimensionless quantity</u> is a pure number with no units attached to it, such as the ratio of two distance or the number of people in the room.

Any equation relating physical quantities need to obey the following rules:
1) The right hand side and the left hand side of the equation must have the same dimensions (e.g., you can’t set a length equal to a time).
2) Any quantities added or subtracted must have the same dimensions (e.g., you can’t add a speed to a mass)
If an equation does not obey these rules, it can't be accepted You can verify that an equation at least makes logical sense by doing a dimensional check, but you cannot confirm that an equation is correct by doing a dimensional check.
