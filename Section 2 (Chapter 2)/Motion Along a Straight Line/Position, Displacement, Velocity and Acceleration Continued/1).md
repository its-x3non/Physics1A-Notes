# Motion in 2 or 3 Dimensions
- We spend the bulk of our time dealing with only 2 dimensions. But we are responsible for extending into 3 dimensions
- Projectile and Circular Motion are 2 special cases that we will spend considerable time on
- Primary goal in dealing a 2 or 3 dimensional problem is to split the problem in 2 or 3 one dimensional simpler problems and solve these simultaneously
- The use of alternative frames of reference is a very powerful tool for solving what seems to be complex problems

# Position and Displacement
A **position vector** points from the origin of a coordinate system to an object's location: **(can't forget the equation)**
Displacement is a *change* in position, A **displacement vector** points from an object's initial position to its final position: **(the equation again)**

# Displacement Vectors
In component form, a displacement vector is expressed as: **(too many equations bruh i'll just take the equation's from chloe's notes)**
The components can be positive or negative, depending on which direction along each axis the object moves (+ or -)
The components of displacement are given by: **(you won't believe it)**

# Velocity Vectors
Recall that <u>average velocity</u> is defined as displacement divided by the time it takes to undergo that displacement: **(EQUATION)**
This becomes the <u>instantaneous velocity</u> as the time interval becomes infinitesimally small: **(YAY)**
<u>Speed is the magnitude of the velocity of the velocity vector</u>: **(EQUATION)**

# Velocity & Trajectory
The <u>trajectory</u> is the path that an object follows as it moves through space.
As the time interval goes to zero, the displacement becomes *tangent to the path* (only touches the path at one point)
**(EQUATION)**
**Important Result:** An object's instantaneous velocity vector is *always* tangent to its trajectory.

# shoot

# Acceleration Vectors
An object's <u>average acceleration</u> is some time interval: **(equuations)**
This becomes the <u>instantaneous acceleration</u> as the time interval becomes infinitesimally small.
**Acceleration is the first derivative of velocity with respect to time.**
**Acceleration is also the 2nd derivative of position with respect to time.**
The *magnitude* of an object's acceleration is given by: **(i love equations)**

# Summary of Kinematic Quantities
Position: **Equation**
Velocity: **(Equation)**
Acceleration: **(equation)**

# Vector Kinematic Equations
The vector kinematic equations are exactly analogous to the 1D kinematic equations from Chapter 2, but with *vectors* for position, velocity, and acceleration.
**WE HAVE TOO MANY EQUATIONS**

# Kinematics: Graphical and Algebraic Methods
<u>Algebraic Method</u> - Write out separate kinematic equations for each coordinate direction and solve for an unknown quantity algebraically. Use subscripts to keep track of motion along the x, y, and z axes. For example: **(i swear to god i am going to say a swear word)**
<u>Graphical Method</u> - Draw the vector addition descried in the kinematics equations, use what you know about geometry to solve for an unknown side length or angle.

# Graphical Representations of Kinematic Equations
Kinematic equations are describing the *addition* of vectors, which can be shown using the tip-to-tail method

# Law of Sines & Cosines
When you represent the addition of 2 vectors graphically, you construct a triangle..
**PICTURES OF TRIANGLES**
These are useful relations to keep in mind when solving a problem involving vector kinematics
