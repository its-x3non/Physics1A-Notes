## Average Acceleration
Acceleration is a way of quantifying how quickly changes in velocity are occurring.
The <u>average acceleration</u> in some time interval is **EQUATION**
Dimensions of acceleration are `[a]` = L/T<sup>2</sup>, SI units of acceleration are meters per seconds squared (m/s<sup>2</sup>).

## Instantaneous Acceleration
<u>Instantaneous Acceleration</u> is the average acceleration over an infinitesimal time interval (as the change of time approaches zero).
It gives the acceleration at a *particular moment* in time, rather than an average over a time interval.
**EQUATIONS**
Acceleration is the first derivative of velocity, and also the 2nd derivative of position with respect to time.
