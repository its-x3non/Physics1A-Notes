# Free Fall
<u>Free Fall</u> is the motion of an object that moves under the influence of *gravity* alone (no air resistance or any other forces).
If an object is dropped, launch straight up, or launched straight down, it will move in a 1D vertical line.

## Free Fall Kinematics
Define the y-axis to aligned with the vertical direction, with the +y direction upwards.
The same kinematic equations that we've seen before apply but with x-> and a<sub>y</sub> -> -g (where g = 9.80m/s<sup>2</sup>)
**EQUATIONS**

## Free Fall: V<sub>y</sub>-t Graph
The V<sub>y</sub>-t Graph is 

## Free Fall: y-t Graph
The y-t graph is a parabola w/ negative curvature. The slope is of the y-t graph

## Direction of  Velocity and acceleration in Free Fall
As the ball moves up, its speed decreases. Acceleration and velocity vectors are in opposite directions.
As the ball moves down, the speed increases. Acceleration and velocity vectors are the same direction.
