# Velocity and Position by Integration
The acceleration of a car is not always constant
The motion may be integrated over many small time intervals to give (equation)

## What do you do when you have varying Accelerations
- Its very rare that acceleration are constant over time as we will see later in chapters most phenomena involve a changing acceleration.
- Sometimes smoothly
	- Harmonic Oscillators, Pendulums, simply pressing the gas pedal in a car harder
- Sometimes Very Abruptly
	- Collisions
