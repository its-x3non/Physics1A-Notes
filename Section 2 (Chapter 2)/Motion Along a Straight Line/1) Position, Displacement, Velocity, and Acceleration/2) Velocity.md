## Average Velocity
<u>Velocity</u> is a measure of *how quickly* and in *what direction* an object is moving. The dimensions of velocity are `[v]` = L/T, SI units of velocity m/s.
A <u>position vs. time graph</u> has position (x) on the vertical axis and time (t) on the horizontal axis.
Average velocity is the *slope* of a line connecting two points on the x-t curve.
(you can probably find the equation)

## Average Speed
<u>Average Speed</u> of an object is the total distance it travels over the time it takes to travel that distance.
$$Average Speed = \frac{distance}{time}$$
$$AverageVelocity = \frac{displacement}{time}$$
*Speed* is always *positive*, since distances and time intervals are always positive.

## Instantaneous Velocity
<u>Instantaneous velocity</u> is the velocity at a *particular moment* in time, rather than an average over a time interval. It is the average velocity over an *infinitesimal* time interval.
The instantaneous velocity is the *slope* of the line tangent to the curve on a position vs time graph.
The *sign* of the slope (+ or -) tells you which *direction* the object is moving in.
How *steep* the line is tells you how *fast* the object is moving (i.e., it indicates the speed).

## Constant Velocity Motion
If an object moves with constant velocity, its x-t graph is linear and its v-t graph is flat.
If an object velocity is chang
