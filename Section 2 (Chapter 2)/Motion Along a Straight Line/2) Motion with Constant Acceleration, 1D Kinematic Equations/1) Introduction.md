## 1D Kinematic Equations
When an object has **constant acceleration**, <u>kinematic equations</u> describe how its position and velocity change over time.
Initial variables (at the start of the motion, time 0):
- object at position x<sub>0</sub> moving with velocity v<sub>0</sub>
(i am missing stuff here)

The following kinematic equations are only valid when an object has **constant acceleration**:
**(THE EQUATIONS)**

## Solving Problems in Physics
- **Identify** the relevant concepts, target variables, and known quantities, as stated or implied in hte problem
- **Set Up** the problem: Choose the equations that you'll use to solve the problem, and draw a sketch of the situation
- **Execute** the solution: This is where you "Do the math"
- **Evaluate** your answer: Compare your answer with your estimates, and reconsider things if there's a discrepancy.
