# Kinematics in 1D
**Kinematics** - A description of motion (i.e., what is the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object?)
**Dynamics** - Deals with the underlying causes of motion. Newton’s Laws of motion provide the framework we’ll use to understand dynamics.
The number of dimensions in some space refers to how many numbers (coordinates) you need in order to specify a location in that space.

<u>Kinematics in one dimension</u> is a description of the motion of objects moving in straight-line paths (1D). For example:
- A car braking on a straight section of road
- A rock dropped off a cliff
- A box sliding down a ramp
- 
To simplify things, we will treat all moving objects as <u>point particles</u> that have zero size. This allows us to:
- Unanimously define the position of an object.
- Ignore rotational motion
- Ignore vibrational motion

## Definition of Position
The <u>position</u> of an object is the set of coordinates that tell you where it is located (given by the variable x in 1D)
To construct a coordinate system, you need to define:
- The <u>Origin</u>: the center of the coordinate system
- The positive and negative coordinate directions

## Definition of Displacement
Displacement (change of x) refers to a *change in position*, and it is defined at the final position minus the initial position.
The *sign* of **change of x (+ or -)** tells you which direction the object has moved in.

## Displacement vs. Distance
The <u>distance</u> an object travels is the total length of the path it follows as it goes from its initial position to its final position
<u>Displacement</u> is simply the change in position 
- Displacement only depends on the starting and end points of the motion, not the path taken
