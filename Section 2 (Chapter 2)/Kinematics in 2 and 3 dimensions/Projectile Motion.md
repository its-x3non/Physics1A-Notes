# Projectile Motion
<u>Projectile Motion</u> is the motion of an object that is thrown or launched into the air. Projectiles can be launched in *any* direction.
Assumptions for projectile motion:
- The projectile moves over a distance that is small compared to the size of the Earth
- The effects of Earth's rotation are negligible.
- The effects air resistance are negligible. Gravity is the only force acting on the object.
Under these assumptions, projectiles are objects that move in 2D with constant acceleration.

# Projectile Motion Kinematic Equations
Standard coordinates: x is horizontal and y is vertical, with up being the +y direction.
The acceleration due to Earth's gravity is down, with a magnitude of g = 9.8 m/s^2

# Initial Velocity of a Projectile
The <u>initial velocity</u> of a projectile is it velocity *immediately after* it is launched.
	In **polar form** the initial velocity is given by the <u>initial speed</u> v<sub>0</sub> and the <u>launch angle</u> (theta)<sub>0</sub>
**i swear to god**

# Projectile Motion
The angle and speed of the projectile are constantly changing
The x-component of velocity is constant
The y-component is equivalent to free fall.

# Range of a Projectile
The <u>range</u> of a projectile (R) is the total horizontal distance it travels. **The following equation is only valid if the final and initial heights of the projectile are the same:**
**the god damn fucking equation** (gotta keep this in a cheat sheet :3)

# Maximum Height of a Projectile
The <u>maximum height (h)</u> is also known as the apex of a trajectory. The maximum height above the launch point that a projectile reaches is given by:
**EQUATION YIPPIE!!!! :33**

# Circular Motion
An Object is accelerating when its velocity (V) is changing over time. This can happen in a few ways:
- The magnitude of v (the speed) is changing
- The direction of v is changing
- Both the magnitude and the direction of v are changing

**An object moving in a circle at a constant speed is in uniform circular motion.**
**Such an object is accelerating, because the direction of its velocity vector is changing.**

# Velocity Acceleration
i'm not gonna write allat (equations)

If an object's velocity and acceleration vectors are parallel, the object is speeding up. If they are antiparallel, the object is slowing down.

Parallel: V<sub>t</sub> has a larger magnitude than V<sub>i</sub>
Antiparallel: V<sub>f</sub> has a 

# Uniform Circular Motion
- **Uniform circular motion** is constant speed along a circular path

# Acceleration for Uniform Circular Motion
DAMN

For uniform circular motion, the instantaneous acceleration always points toward the center of the circle and is called the centripetal acceleration.
The magnitude of the acceleration is: **equation**
The period T is the time for one revolution, and **another equation**

# Uniform Circular Motion
**pictuor**

# Non-Uniform Motion in a Circle (speeding up)
- Car speeding up along a circular path
**anothr pictor**
- Acceleration vector no longer point strictly towards the center

# Non-Uniform Motion in a circle (slowing down)
- Car slowing down along a circular path
**so many god damn fucking pictures i swear to god**

# Nonuniform circular motion
- If the speed varies, the motion is *nonuniform circular motion.*
- The radial acceleration component is still **(equation)** but there is also a tangential acceleration component that a<sub>tan</sub> that is *parallel* to the instantaneous velocity. 
**holy shit**
