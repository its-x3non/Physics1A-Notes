# Projectile Motion
<u>Projectile Motion</u> is the motion of an object that is thrown or launched into the air. Projectiles can be launched in *any* direction.
Assumptions for projectile motion:
- The projectile moves over a distance that is small compared to the size of the Earth
- The effects of Earth's rotation are negligible.
- The effects air resistance are negligible. Gravity is the only force acting on the object.
Under these assumptions, projectiles are objects that move in 2D with constant acceleration.

# Projectile Motion Kinematic Equations
Standard coordinates: x is horizontal and y is vertical, with up being the +y direction.
The acceleration due to Earth's gravity is down, with a magnitude of g = 9.8 m/s^2

# Initial Velocity of a Projectile
The <u>initial velocity</u> of a projectile is it velocity *immediately after* it is launched.
	In **polar form** the initial velocity is given by the <u>initial speed</u> v<sub>0</sub> and the <u>launch angle</u> (theta)<sub>0</sub>
i swear to god

# Projectile Motion
The angle and speed of the projectile are constantly changing
The x-component of velocity is constant
The y-component is equivalent to free fall.
